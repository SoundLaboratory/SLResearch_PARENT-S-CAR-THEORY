CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication

This is a human-readable summary of the Legal Code (read the full text).

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
contribute to the Commons to promote the ideals of free culture and open
science.

To the extent possible under law, the person who associated CC0 with this
Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, has waived all of his or her Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work to the extent permitted by law, and has dedicated
the Work to the public domain.

No Copyright

The Affirmer hereby explicitly waives all copyright and related rights in
the Work to the extent permitted by law, including without limitation any
rights in copyright, database rights, and related rights. The Affirmer
explicitly disclaims any warranty or liability for the Work, and makes no
representation that the Work is accurate, complete, or suitable for any
purpose.
